# ASFRM-Winter-Break-Stuff
Undergrad MechE trying to explore Mechatronics and get hands-on experience during the winter break
# Axial Flux Switch Reluctance Motor(ASFRM):
- Aim: Prototype a robotic actuator that contains no permanent magnets
- Why:
  1. More sustainable
  2. Could possibly be cheaper due to no pm magnets
  3. Fun 
# CubeSat:
- I'm using github as documentation as we figure out how to integrate a new IMU into the Pycubed(more on that in the CubeSat folder)
- **Learning KiCad and circuit design!**
