# ASFRM-Winter-Break-Stuff
Undergrad MechE trying to do as much as possible before the next semester begins!
# Axial Flux Switch Reluctance Motor(ASFRM):
- A motor with no magnets is more sustainable and cheap.
- It works through magnetic reluctance
- Axial Flux becuase the shape(pancake) is great for saving space on something like an E-bike
- A lot of people have DIY'd these, but I haven't seen any with a **PCB stator**
- I want to have fun with PCB coils for the stator
- Model the Magnetic feild of the whole motor using Maxwell or other FEAs
- Start off with a small motor I can eventually scale up to be useful
- **PCB stator**: Instead of hand-winded coils on the stator, I want to have them and other neccessary sensors for motor control on the PCB.
- **Gonna learn B-feild modelling and how to design PCBs! Yipeee!!!!**

# CubeSat:
- I'm using github as documentation
- **Learning KiCad and circuit design! Yipeee!!!!!!**
