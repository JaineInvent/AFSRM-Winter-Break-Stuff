# Notes, Records, and Conclusions from simulations 
### Magnetic feild due to different coil shapes and pcb layers
| Coil configuration | Top \|Bz\| (G) | Bottom \|Bz\| (G) | Turns |
|-------------------:|--------------:|------------------:|--------:|
| Wedge, 2 layers    | 8301.61       | 4185.61           |26
| Spiral, 2 layers   | 8434.50       |                   |55

## Simulated B-feild in z-direction:
The z-direction is most relevant in an Axial Flux SRM. This is because the torque results from the magnetic flux passing from the PCB coils through the laminated steel sheets of the rotor.
